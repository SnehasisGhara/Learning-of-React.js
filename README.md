Getting Started with React.js
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile apps. React allows you to design simple views for each state in your application, and it will efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes.

Prerequisites
Before you start learning React.js, you should have a basic understanding of:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript (ES6 features)
Installation
To get started with React.js, you need to install Node.js and npm. After installing Node.js, you can install the create-react-app package, which is a command-line tool for creating React.js applications.

Copy code
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
This command will create a new React.js application in a directory called my-app. The npm start command will start the development server, and you can view the application by opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Basic Concepts
Components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. A component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.
JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, which makes it possible to write HTML-like code in the JavaScript file. JSX produces React "elements" and it is optional to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.
State and Props: State is a data structure that starts with a default value when a Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events. Props (short for properties) are a Component's configuration. They are received from above and immutable as far as the Component receiving them is concerned.
Lifecycle Methods: Lifecycle methods are special methods that automatically get called as your component gets rendered and re-rendered on the UI.
Event Handling: Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
